genome-data-integration
=======================

Scripts used to integrate data from multiple genome sequencing datasets and form consensus variant calls.  The process and these scripts used to generate consensus calls for NA12878 are described in the pre-print of our paper at http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4661.  The calls generated for NA12878 described in http://genomeinabottle.org/blog-entry/nist-na12878-highly-confident-integrated-genotype-calls-available-ftp-site and available at ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/variant_calls/NIST. 

These scripts were used on Sun Grid Engine to parallelize processing.
